The ChemOntology refers to an explicit chemical ontology-based method developed to speed up reaction path searches, 
as detailed in a publication on ChemRxiv. This method uses a structured knowledge base of chemical information to provide a more efficient and reusable approach to exploring how chemical reactions can occur, 
aiding researchers in various fields of chemistry, particularly theoretical and computational chemistry
